# earthquake-analysis
This project implements anomaly detection in seismic data using Gradient Boosting Regression and clustering techniques. It analyzes earthquake parameters like depth, latitude, and longitude to identify anomalies, visualizes them on a map, and evaluates model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error and RÂ² Score.
